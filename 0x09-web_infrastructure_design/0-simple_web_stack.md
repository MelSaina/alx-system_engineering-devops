1. User Accessing the Website:
Let's start with a user who wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com.

2. Server:
A server is a powerful computer system that stores and manages various resources and services. In this case, we have one server that will handle all the components of our web infrastructure.

3. Domain Name and DNS:
The domain name, in this case, is "www.foobar.com". The role of the domain name is to provide a human-readable address that represents the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this scenario). Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses. The DNS record type associated with "www.foobar.com" is an "A" record, which points directly to the server's IP address.

4. Web Server (Nginx):
The web server, in this case, Nginx, acts as the first point of contact for incoming web requests. It receives requests from users, processes them, and sends appropriate responses. Nginx handles tasks like serving static files, load balancing, and managing connections.

5. Application Server:
The application server hosts the application's codebase and processes dynamic content generation. It takes user requests forwarded by the web server, executes the necessary business logic, interacts with the database, and returns dynamic content (HTML pages, JSON data, etc.) to the web server for delivery to the user.

6. Application Files (Code Base):
The application files or code base contain the source code of the website's application. This code is executed by the application server to generate dynamic content based on user requests.

7. Database (MySQL):
The database (MySQL in this case) stores and manages the website's data. It's where information like user accounts, posts, comments, etc., are stored. The application server interacts with the database to retrieve or update data as needed.

8. Communication with User's Computer:
The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP protocol. When the user enters "www.foobar.com" in their browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the website's content. The server processes the request, generates the appropriate content, and sends back an HTTP response that the browser can render.

Issues with this Infrastructure:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since all components are hosted on a single server, if that server fails or experiences issues, the entire website will go down. There's no redundancy or backup server to handle traffic if the primary server fails.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
When maintenance is needed, such as deploying new code or updating the web server, the website might need to be taken offline temporarily. This can result in downtime, making the website inaccessible to users during that period.

3. Scalability Challenges:
This infrastructure cannot easily scale to handle a large influx of incoming traffic. As traffic increases, the single server might become overwhelmed, leading to slow performance or crashes.

In a real-world scenario, addressing these issues would involve implementing strategies like load balancing for redundancy, using a separate staging environment for testing updates before deployment, and considering distributed architectures for better scalability.
