What Happens When You Type Https://Www.Google.Com In Your Browser And Press Enter.
The moment you open your web browser and type "https://www.google.com" into the address bar, this starts an interesting chain of events. There are many layers of infrastructure and technology involved in this seemingly straightforward process. Let us examine the path taken by a web request as it makes its way from your browser to Google's servers.
DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type "https://www.google.com," your computer contacts a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name ("www.google.com") into an IP address. This IP address is needed to locate the web server that hosts Google's website.
TCP/IP:
Once your computer has the IP address, it uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) to establish a connection with the web server. TCP ensures reliable data transmission, while IP handles routing and addressing.
Firewall:
Before reaching the target server, your request passes through your local network's firewall. Firewalls act as security barriers and filter incoming and outgoing traffic. They help protect your computer and network from malicious access.
HTTPS/SSL:
Like many other websites, Google encrypts the data sent between your browser and its server using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). The protocols Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its descendant Transport Layer Security (TLS) create an encrypted connection to guarantee that data transferred and received is private and uncorruptible.
Load-Balancer
Many large websites, like Google, employ load balancers. To provide high availability and performance, these devices split incoming traffic among several web servers. In order to distribute the load more evenly, the load balancer routes your request to one of Google's web servers.
Web Server
Once your request reaches a Google web server, it processes the request. The web server retrieves the requested web page, in this case, the Google homepage. It may also gather data from various sources, such as databases and application servers, to compile the page you see.
Application Server
Application servers are used by web applications because they frequently need to generate dynamic content. These servers run the software in charge of handling user authentication, processing requests, and retrieving data from databases.
Database:
Databases store and retrieve information for more sophisticated online apps like Google. The application server interacts with databases to get the required data when you do a search or access personalized content.

The requested web page is then put together using dynamic content and user-specific information and delivered back to your browser through the same path (TCP/IP, load-balancing, firewall, SSL, etc.). The well-known Google homepage then appears on your screen after your browser has finished rendering the page.

Thanks to the complex systems and technologies used, the entire process—from entering the URL to viewing the webpage—takes place in a fraction of a second.
Therefore, the next time you use Google or access any website, keep in mind that it takes more than just a single click to bring the web to your fingers. Instead, it's a complex, coordinated dance of systems and protocols.
