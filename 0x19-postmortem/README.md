# Web Stack Outage Incident Postmortem

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**
- Start Time: November 8, 2023, 14:30 UTC
- End Time: November 8, 2023, 17:45 UTC

**Impact:**
The outage impacted our core payment processing service, causing a delay in transaction processing for approximately 2 hours. This disruption affected 10% of our users, leading to frustration and potential financial inconvenience.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause was identified as a software bug in the latest deployment that went unnoticed during the testing phase.

## Timeline:

**Issue Detection:**
- November 8, 2023, 14:30 UTC
- An engineer noticed a surge in error rates while monitoring the payment processing service.

**Actions Taken:**
- Rolled back the latest deployment to the previous stable version.
- Investigated the logs to identify the source of the errors.
- Assumed a database issue and initiated a database health check.
- Escalated the incident to the development team for a detailed code review.

**Misleading Paths:**
- Initially focused on database issues without considering recent deployments.
- Assumed a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden increase in error rates.

**Escalation:**
- Escalated to the development team within 20 minutes of detection, involving both backend and frontend developers.

**Resolution:**
- Rolled back to the previous stable deployment, eliminating the software bug.
- Implemented additional automated tests in the deployment pipeline to catch similar issues in the future.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Cause:**
The root cause was a software bug introduced in the latest deployment, causing errors in the payment processing logic.

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved by rolling back to the previous stable deployment and implementing additional automated tests in the deployment pipeline to catch similar issues during the testing phase.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Improvements:**
1. **Automated Testing:** Strengthen the automated testing suite to cover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities in the payment processing logic.
2. **Code Review:** Conduct more thorough code reviews before deploying changes to production.
3. **Deployment Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring for deployments to quickly identify and respond to anomalies.

**Tasks:**
1. **Post-Deployment Checks:** Establish a checklist for post-deployment checks to ensure the stability of critical services after each deployment.
2. **Training:** Provide additional training to development and operations teams on identifying and addressing issues related to software deployments.
3. **Communication Protocol:** Enhance communication protocols for incident escalation, ensuring swift and effective collaboration between teams during critical incidents.

This postmortem outlines the timeline of the outage incident, the root cause analysis, and the measures taken to resolve the issue and prevent its recurrence. Through continuous improvement in our development and deployment processes, we aim to minimize the impact of such incidents on our users and maintain the reliability of our web stack.
